# OpenFaceUE Plugin
This project is a Plugin for [Unreal Engine 4](https://github.com/EpicGames) of [OpenFace](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace) library – _OpenFace_ is a state-of-the art tool intended for facial landmark detection, head pose estimation, facial action unit recognition, and eye-gaze estimation made by CMU and Cambridge University.



## About

Current developement is only available for Unreal Engine **4.18** branch in **Win64** platforms

Support control objects in level using head pose estimation and gaze inside UE4, camera aquisition is made by OpenCV in running thread and can be used as movie texture inside level to provide Augmented Reality composition. Face data position and analysis can be used too but only data for now. All expose as component to be used in blueprint class.

* Development Road-map:
     - Use landing markers data for realtime facial animation integrated as an animation blueprint of UE skeleton morphtargets;
     - Use Action units inside editor;
     - Multithread for improve aquisition frames;
     - Some filters to improve data aquisition time-series in order to apply in recorded data (2nd order lowpass, kalman and others); 
  
 * Dependency: (ThirdParty plugin directory)
     - OpenCV 3.0+
     - Boost C++ Library
     - DLib vision computing lib
     - OpenFace
     - OpenBlas
     - Intel TBB
     - NVIDIA CUDA 8+ (not included)

Many thanks to [**TadasBaltrusaitis**](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis) by the great job to bring OpenFace in github a great tool specially when the commercial solutions of facial capture is based em computer vision matlab models or depth sensors APIs and not well documented for developers and enthusiasts in general to achieve high precision.
